Java Md5 hashing algorithm

For practice's (and fun's) sake, I wrote my own MD5 hash generator in java.

The MD5 message-digest algorithm is a widely used (although deprecated) hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. 
MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321.

This project is built with Maven and I wrote Junit tests to test it.
